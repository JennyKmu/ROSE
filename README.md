# ROSE - v0.4.0 DEV

This program is intended to be used as an external tool to Railroads Online server hosts. It will read save files, allow to modify entries within it, and then save the file (creating a backup file in the process).

# This is a fork for experimenting.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/JennyKmu/RRO_savefile_editor/wiki) for installation and use instructions, as well as full list of features, ongoing work,...
